A data science unit's data cleaning assignment further developed to determine clusters from the coordinate of recorded bear attacks in the North Americas over a real world map of the region from geopandas. Project can be classified as finished as I don't know what else to do with it but I might circle back around to either increase the scale or make an interactive to determine different animal attack locations.
